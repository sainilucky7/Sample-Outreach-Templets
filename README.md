Hi <Name>,

I came across your GitHub profile and was really impressed by your work on <specific repo or project>, especially the part where you implemented <specific ML detail — e.g., custom training loop, transformer architecture, data pipeline, model optimization>. It’s clear you have strong hands‑on experience with <PyTorch/TensorFlow/JAX/etc.> and a solid understanding of <ML domain — e.g., computer vision, NLP, generative models>.

I’m working with a team building <brief description of the product or ML challenge>, and your background in <relevant skill from their repo> stood out immediately.

If you’re open to a short conversation, I’d love to share more about the role and learn what you’re looking for next.

Best,
